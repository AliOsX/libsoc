What is libsoc?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

libsoc is a C library to interface with common peripherals found in 
System on Chips through generic Linux Kernel interfaces.

It is aimed at new Linux users, and intends to be a stepping stone to 
enable a user to get started quickly. It is optimised for reliability 
rather than speed. While the library should be fast, no guarantees are 
made on it's determinism and it should not be used in time critical 
routines.

Why libsoc?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

libsoc was born due to the influx of new embedded Linux boards becoming 
available cheap, and to hobbyists. There are currently numerous 
libraries that do interfacing with common SoC peripherals, but they all 
tend to be centred around a particular board or SoC. This leads to board 
specific hacks and in some cases direct bypassing of the Linux Kernel.

libsoc aims to be generic and compatible with any SoC that has drivers 
exposing the correct interfaces for the defined peripheral. 

What peripherals does it support?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

libsoc currently only supports GPIO through the sysfs interface.

Future ideas are:

- I2C
- SPIDEV
- PWM
- A/D Converters

Does libsoc support the SoC on my board?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The real question here is, do your SoC drivers use the generic Linux 
Kernel interfaces to expose functionality to userspace. If the answer is
yes, then libsoc supports your board!

Can I help?

libsoc is Open Source Software and as such you are welcome to browse the 
code and either add features, or fix bugs. Please submit pull requests, 
and bugs to http://www.github.com/jackmitch/libsoc. If you have any
