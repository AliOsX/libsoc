Description: Development files for common System On Chip peripherals Library
 libsoc is a C library to interface with common peripherals found in
 System on Chips through generic Linux Kernel interfaces.
 .
 It is aimed at new Linux users, and intends to be a stepping stone to
 enable a user to get started quickly. It is optimised for reliability
 rather than speed. While the library should be fast, no guarantees are
 made on it's determinism and it should not be used in time critical
 routines.
 .
 This package includes the development files.
